Freshman Student: Trying to see their future classes or requirements; Four year plan; Information isn't all in one spot for easy access.

Senior Student: Trying to see what classes they need to fill out their degree and/or have left. No easy way to keep track of these classes and check them off.

Advisor: Need a program to show students what they need to get done and what classes they need to take, not having a program to do that easily for a lot of students.
