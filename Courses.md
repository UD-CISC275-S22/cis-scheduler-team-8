Six additional credits of computer science technical electives numbered 301 or above, except for CISC 355, CISC 356, CISC 357, CISC 465, CISC 366 and CISC 466. Because of their very nature, Experimental Courses (courses with an x67 number) must be approved beforehand by the CIS Undergraduate Committee before being accepted toward the requirement for these six additional credits of computer science.  At most 3 credits of Vertically Integrated Projects (CISC 387 and 487) may be applied towards this requirement.

Twelve credits in advanced courses in a focus area approved by the student’s CISC advisor and the CISC Undergraduate Coordinator.
Students are encouraged to explore how other subject areas impact and are impacted by computer science. Focus area courses must be distinct from other CISC requirements and technical electives.
